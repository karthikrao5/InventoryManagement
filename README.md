2. Clone this repo on the Desktop directory or anywhere you like.

3. Run `./dev-env-setup.sh` in Scripts directory. Make sure that the script has execute permission.

4. Reboot the virtual machine.

5. Run `php -S localhost:8080` from root directory of the repo (where index.php is at)

6. Open brower from the virtual machine and type `localhost:8080/hello/{whatever name you want}` to the address bar to see the hello world example.
